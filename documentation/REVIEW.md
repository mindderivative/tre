# Documentation Review — September 2026

Reviewer: Claude (Cowork), acting as Principal Engineer / Lead Tech Architect, per project standing instructions.
Scope: `DESIGN.md`, `TECHNICAL.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION.md`, reviewed in that order. All findings below have been implemented directly in those four files; this document is the record of what was found and what changed.

Status: **All findings implemented.** See "Follow-up: Rust/Python Language Migration," "Review of Rust-Specific Additions," "Full Documentation Review," and "Engineering Decisions: Suggested Improvements Actioned" below for subsequent, out-of-band work (all 2026-09-04) not part of this original review.

---

## How to read this

Each finding lists: severity, the document(s) touched, what was wrong, and what changed. Severities:

- **Critical** — a real gap in the architecture itself (not just the writing), left unaddressed it causes production incidents or silent correctness/perf regressions.
- **Should-fix** — a real risk or inconsistency, not immediately fatal, but will cause confusion or rework later.
- **Nice-to-have** — cheap insurance, low cost to add, meaningful payoff if it ever triggers.

---

## DESIGN.md

### 1. [Critical] No failure-mode / degradation principle
The five core principles (§2) covered the happy path only — zero-alloc, separation of concerns, frame budget, deterministic order, resolution independence — with no statement of what happens when any of those assumptions breaks.

**Change:** Added §2.6 "Explicit Failure Modes & Graceful Degradation," enumerating the five failure classes that must have a documented response before a subsystem ships: device loss / swapchain acquire failure, atlas exhaustion beyond LRU capacity, malformed SVG input, ring buffer / transient pool starvation, and shader compilation failure. Ties back to the project's no-exceptions rule (`std::expected`/error codes only).

### 2. [Should-fix] Ambiguous heterogeneous-primitive batching model
§8.1.2 claimed text (MSDF, R8/RGB8) and color icons (RGBA8) can share a draw call via bindless textures, but MSDF and RGBA sampling are different shader logic — normally a different `PipelineStateId`, which is itself a sort-key field, so the claim as written was self-contradictory.

**Change:** Added a "Shader Unification" clarification: `PipelineStateId` selects a shader *family*; within a family, a per-vertex shader-mode tag (packed into a spare `params` lane) branches between SDF-rect, plain-texture, and MSDF evaluation. One pipeline, one draw call, a cheap per-fragment branch instead of a state switch.

### 3. [Nice-to-have] Animation state ownership unspecified
§12.3 defined spring/lerp-decay math but never said who persists `x`, `v`, `x_target` across frames.

**Change:** Added §12.4 "Animation State Ownership" — the UI framework's widget tree owns this state; the Vector Math Engine is a stateless evaluation library. Prevents a second, drifting source of truth.

### 4. Documentation hygiene
§11.1's sRGB↔linear formula now points to TECHNICAL.md §6.2 (canonical) instead of restating it. See "Cross-Cutting" below.

---

## TECHNICAL.md

### 5. [Bug] Malformed budget table
§1's table had a header row but no `|---|---|---|` delimiter — breaks under strict CommonMark rendering.

**Change:** Delimiter row added.

### 6. [Should-fix] SPMC claimed, only one consumer described
§8 specified the event queue as Single-Producer *Multi*-Consumer, but DESIGN.md §5.1 describes exactly one consumer (the UI framework's logic tick). SPMC lock-free queues carry materially more complexity (consumer-side CAS races, ABA hazards) than SPSC for no benefit if there's truly one consumer.

**Change:** Corrected to SPSC, with a note that upgrading to SPMC requires naming the second consumer explicitly when one is actually added.

### 7. [Critical] No zero-allocation enforcement mechanism
The headline "0 bytes/frame" constraint had no verification method — an aspirational rule with no way to know if it's ever violated.

**Change:** Added §3.4 "Zero-Allocation Enforcement": debug/profile builds override `operator new`/`delete` to assert against a thread-local "render tick active" flag; CI runs the full suite under this guard as a hard gate (not just a benchmark), compiled out entirely in release builds.

### 8. [Critical] No shader cross-compilation strategy
Three backends (Vulkan/DX12/Metal) targeted, zero documents said how one shader source reaches SPIR-V, DXIL, and MSL.

**Change:** Added §9.3 "Shader Authoring & Cross-Compilation": single HLSL source, DXC to SPIR-V (Vulkan) and DXIL (DX12) natively, SPIRV-Cross to MSL (Metal), all at build time via CMake — never at runtime in a shipping build.

### 9. Bit-layout & documentation hygiene
§4 (sort key) and §5.1 (vertex format) now state only the numeric budget and reference ARCHITECTURE.md as canonical. See "Cross-Cutting."

---

## ARCHITECTURE.md

### 10. [Critical] Depth ID headroom too thin
The sort key's Depth ID field was 16 bits (65,536 slots) against a stated `>10,000 node` design target — only 6.5x margin, no overflow behavior specified.

**Change:** Rebalanced the 64-bit key: Layer 16 / Pipeline 16 / **Texture 12** / **Depth 20** bits (Texture only needed 12 bits — the engine maintains a few dozen atlases, not thousands). Depth ID now has 1,048,576 slots. Added a debug-build overflow assert and a release-build fallback (split into two sequential sub-frame passes rather than wrapping the counter). This bit-layout change was propagated to TECHNICAL.md and IMPLEMENTATION.md as well.

### 11. [Should-fix] Batching guarantee was traversal-order-dependent, not structural
§4.2 required both matching sort-key bits *and* matching `clipBounds` to merge into a batch, but `clipBounds` isn't in the key — same-clip commands are only contiguous post-sort because UI traversal happens to correlate with clip nesting. That correlation breaks under z-index overrides (DESIGN.md §7.1), which the docs already acknowledge as a case that reorders paint order.

**Change:** Documented this explicitly as a known, deliberate limitation: correctness is preserved (the explicit `clipBounds` compare prevents any incorrect merge), but the "single-digit draw call" target becomes a soft target under clip/z-index interleaving. Also added: Depth ID is now assigned *after* z-index resolution (true final-paint-order index), and a documented future fix (clip-bucketing secondary pass) is named rather than silently deferred.

### 12. [Should-fix] Virtual RHI dispatch vs. the project's own "no virtual in tight loops" standard
`IRhiDevice`/`IRhiCommandBuffer` (§6) are pure-virtual interfaces called on every batch — technically virtual dispatch, which the project's coding standards flag on review, with no justification recorded.

**Change:** Added an explicit note: dispatch is per-*batch* (single-digit to low-hundreds calls/frame), not per-primitive or per-vertex; overhead is amortized and negligible against the CPU budget. This is a bounded, deliberate exception — per-primitive code paths must still avoid virtual calls entirely.

### 13. [Nice-to-have] No PSO blend/depth-state specification
Painter's-algorithm ordering by Depth ID implies depth-test-off / blend-on, but this was never stated — a future contributor could "fix" this by enabling depth testing and silently break transparency ordering.

**Change:** Added §6.1 "Default Pipeline State (PSO) Configuration": depth test/write disabled, premultiplied-alpha blending in linear space, culling disabled.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION.md

### 14. [Critical — process risk] No walking skeleton before first pixel
Phases 1–5 (platform, RHI backends, memory pools, geometry/SVG, typography, multi-threaded canvas) build entirely before Phase 6 produces a single visible pixel — five phases of integration risk accumulating with zero end-to-end validation.

**Change:** Added Phase 0 "Walking Skeleton": a single-backend, single-threaded, minimal path from `Canvas::DrawRoundedRect` through a trivial one-element sort/flatten to `DrawIndexed` and present — validates the Canvas→IR→RHI contract shape before deeper investment in any one subsystem.

### 15. [Should-fix] No SVG input hardening
Phase 3.3's tessellator had no stated defense against adversarial SVG (recursive `<use>` bombs, unbounded point counts, deep group nesting) despite creative-workstation apps being a named target audience.

**Change:** Added a hardening task: hard caps on recursion depth, point count, and nesting depth, rejected via `std::expected` before tessellation begins — with an explicit call-out that a "trusted-SVG-only" integration must state that assumption itself rather than inherit it silently.

### 16. [Should-fix] No correctness testing strategy, only performance
TECHNICAL §9.2 and the implementation plan covered perf regression only — nothing validated that the batching/sort pipeline produces *correct* output, which is the more dangerous failure mode (fast but wrong, silently).

**Change:** Added Phase 9 "Testing & Validation Strategy": adversarial radix-sort unit tests, atlas-packer fragmentation/eviction tests, a batching-equivalence pixel-diff test (batched vs. naive per-primitive reference render), SVG fuzz testing, and CI gates for both the zero-allocation guard and the transient-pool balance assertion below.

### 17. [Nice-to-have] No transient-pool leak detection
An unbalanced `PushLayer`/`PopLayer` pair would starve the transient render target pool silently over many frames with no attributable failure point.

**Change:** Added a debug-mode balance assertion (Phase 2, Step 2.2): depth counter per `Canvas`, asserted zero at frame boundary.

---

## Cross-cutting: documentation hygiene

The 64-bit sort-key formula, the 32-byte `UiVertex` struct, the sRGB↔linear formula, and the MSDF opacity formula were each restated near-verbatim across three or four of these documents. That's real technical debt in the doc set itself — change one bit-field width, and four files need synchronized edits or they silently drift (which is exactly what had already happened: the Depth ID fix above would otherwise have needed hand-applying in four places).

**Change:** Established single canonical locations and made every other document reference them instead of restating:

- **Sort key bit layout & rationale** → canonical in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.1. `TECHNICAL.md` §4 and `IMPLEMENTATION.md` Step 6.1 now state only the numeric budget / task, with a reference.
- **`UiVertex` struct** → canonical in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.1. `TECHNICAL.md` §5.1 and `IMPLEMENTATION.md` Step 3.1 reference it.
- **sRGB ↔ Linear conversion formula** → canonical in `TECHNICAL.md` §6.2. `DESIGN.md` §11.1 and `IMPLEMENTATION.md` Step 7.1 reference it.
- **MSDF opacity formula** → canonical in `TECHNICAL.md` §5.3. `IMPLEMENTATION.md` Step 4.2 references it.

Going forward: if a number or struct field needs to change, edit the canonical section first, then check the three cross-reference notes still make sense. Don't restate the value in a second document — that's exactly the pattern that let the old 16-bit Depth ID ship unnoticed in three places.

## Follow-up: Rust/Python Language Migration (2026-09-04)

Status: **Implemented.** This is a subsequent project decision, not a finding from the September 2026 review above — recorded here as a follow-up entry rather than folded into the numbered findings, since the review itself is closed.

### 18. [Decision] Engine implementation language changed from C++ to Rust; Python UI framework added as the reference integration

All four documents previously specified C++20 throughout: compiler targets, `std::expected`-based error handling, C++ struct/class definitions for `UiVertex`, `UiDrawCommand`, and the `IRhiDevice`/`IRhiCommandBuffer` interfaces, and a CMake-based build system.

**Change:** All four documents updated to specify **Rust** as the engine's implementation language, with the project's own high-level UI framework built in **Python** as the engine's first consumer, while keeping the engine itself language-agnostic for whatever UI framework binds to it. Per-document changes:

- **DESIGN.md:** Executive Summary reworded to state the engine is implemented in Rust with Python as the first consumer. Section 2.6 restated in terms of `Result<T, EngineError>` and panic-vs-FFI-unwind safety instead of `std::expected`/C++ exceptions. New Section 2.7 "Implementation Language & Cross-Language Boundary" added, establishing the engine as language-agnostic via a stable C-ABI, with Python explicitly framed as the reference integration rather than a privileged special case. Section 3 gets a pointer naming the Python UI framework as the reference/dogfooding integration.
- **TECHNICAL.md:** Section 9.1 rewritten for the Rust toolchain (edition/MSRV, `unsafe` policy, no-dynamic-type-inspection-in-hot-paths as the RTTI-ban equivalent, no-unwinding-across-FFI rule). Section 9.2 rewritten for a Cargo workspace, `rustfmt`/`clippy`, and `cargo bench`/`cargo test` CI in place of CMake/clang-format/clang-tidy. Section 9.3's build-integration step updated from a CMake custom step to a Cargo `build.rs`. New Section 9.4 "Cross-Language FFI & Python Bindings" added, defining the ABI shape, error propagation, memory-ownership, and PyO3 binding rules.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md:** `UiVertex` (Section 3.1) and `UiDrawCommand`/`CommandType` (Section 3.2) struct/enum definitions translated to Rust (`#[repr(C, align(16))]`, `#[repr(u8)]`, const-assert size checks in place of `static_assert`). The `IRhiDevice`/`IRhiCommandBuffer` C++ virtual-class interfaces (Section 6) rewritten as Rust traits (`RhiDevice`, `RhiCommandBuffer`); the dispatch-exception rationale from finding #12 above is reworded from "C++ virtual dispatch" to "`dyn Trait` dispatch" but the underlying justification (once-per-batch, not per-vertex) is unchanged.
- **IMPLEMENTATION.md:** Platform-bridge, RHI-backend, and text-shaping tasks (Phases 1, 2, 4) annotated with their Rust binding crates (`windows-rs`, `wayland-client`/`x11rb`, `objc2`/`objc2-app-kit`/`objc2-metal`, `ash`, `harfbuzz_rs`, `freetype-rs`). The FMA-intrinsic and vertex-size-assertion tasks (Phase 3, Step 3.1) updated to Rust equivalents (`core::arch::x86_64`, `const _: () = assert!(...)`). The Architectural Decision Matrix gets a new "Implementation Language" row. New **Phase 10** "Cross-Language Bindings & Python UI Framework Integration" added, covering the `tre-ffi` C-ABI crate and PyO3-based Python bindings.

**Rationale (as given by the project):** Rust's ownership model provides compile-time memory- and data-race-safety for the zero-allocation, lock-free multi-threaded design (DESIGN.md Sections 2.1, 6.3) without a runtime GC that could threaten the frame budget (DESIGN.md Section 2.3). The C-ABI boundary keeps the engine's public surface usable by any UI framework language, not only Python — the Python UI framework exercises that boundary as proof it holds, rather than being a reason to special-case it.

**Note for future reviewers:** This entry is a language-migration record, not a re-review. The structural/architectural findings from the original September 2026 review (the sort-key bit layout, the batching model, the failure-mode taxonomy, etc.) are unaffected by the language change — only their code-level expression (C++ syntax → Rust syntax) was updated. A dedicated review of the Rust-specific additions introduced by this migration was performed on 2026-09-04 — see "Review of Rust-Specific Additions" below (findings #19–22), which caught a critical panic-strategy contradiction in exactly the FFI-safety mechanism this note flagged as unreviewed.

---

## Review of Rust-Specific Additions (2026-09-04)

Reviewer: Claude (Cowork), acting as Principal Engineer / Lead Tech Architect, per project standing instructions.
Scope: the Rust-specific mechanisms introduced by the language migration above (#18) — the `unsafe` policy, the FFI panic-safety mechanism, the `tre-ffi`/`cdylib` build model, and the PyO3 binding layer — across `TECHNICAL.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION.md`. This is the follow-up review flagged as outstanding in #18's original "Note for future reviewers."

Status: **All findings implemented.**

### 19. [Critical] Panic strategy contradicts its own FFI-safety mechanism
TECHNICAL.md Section 9.1 stated the `cdylib`/`staticlib` build targets set `panic = "abort"`, while that same paragraph — plus DESIGN.md Section 2.7 and IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 10 Step 10.1 — relies on `std::panic::catch_unwind` at every FFI entry point to convert a panic into a recoverable `EngineError`. These are mutually exclusive: `panic = "abort"` terminates the process the instant a panic fires, before any stack unwinding occurs, so `catch_unwind` can never trigger and silently becomes dead code. As written, any panic anywhere in the engine crashes the host Python process outright — precisely the outcome Section 2.7 says the `catch_unwind` wrapper exists to prevent.

**Change:** TECHNICAL.md Section 9.1 corrected: the `tre-ffi` crate and its full dependency graph must build with the default `panic = "unwind"` strategy, and `panic = "abort"` is now explicitly called out as prohibited on any profile used to build the shipped `cdylib`/`staticlib`, with the reasoning (it makes `catch_unwind` a no-op) stated inline so a future contributor optimizing binary size doesn't reintroduce it.

### 20. [Should-fix] "Only crate compiled into the cdylib" is imprecise to the point of being misleading
TECHNICAL.md Section 9.2 and IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 10 Step 10.1 both stated that `tre-ffi` is "the only crate compiled into the shipped `cdylib`/`staticlib`." Taken literally this is false: `tre-engine` and the RHI backend crates' code must be statically linked into that same binary for the engine to function at all. The intended meaning — that `tre-ffi` is the only crate whose items are exported as public `extern "C"` symbols — was never actually stated.

**Change:** Both documents reworded to distinguish *linked into* (true of every crate in the dependency graph) from *exports symbols from* (true of `tre-ffi` alone), so the symbol-hiding goal is stated accurately instead of implying the engine and RHI backends aren't part of the shipped binary at all.

### 21. [Should-fix] `unsafe` policy omitted the crate that needs it most
TECHNICAL.md Section 9.1's `unsafe` policy named only the RHI backend crates and the ring-buffer/arena allocators as permitted `unsafe` locations. The `tre-ffi` crate — described in Section 9.4 and IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 10 as converting opaque raw pointers back into Rust references and manually transferring buffer ownership across the C-ABI boundary — is one of the most `unsafe`-code-dense crates in the workspace, yet the policy as written never authorized it to contain any.

**Change:** Added `tre-ffi` to the permitted-`unsafe` list, and made the rest of the workspace's stance explicit: every other crate, including `tre-engine` itself, carries `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` — the policy now names a complete, closed set of allowed locations rather than leaving an implicit "everywhere else, presumably not" gap.

### 22. [Nice-to-have] Unspecified ordering between GIL release and panic-catching
TECHNICAL.md Section 9.4 documented GIL release (`Python::allow_threads`) around blocking engine calls and, separately, `catch_unwind`-based panic recovery (Section 9.1), but never stated which wraps which. If a panic fired while the GIL was released and `catch_unwind` were scoped only around the inner blocking call, the conversion to an `EngineError` would happen without the GIL held — unsafe for any subsequent PyO3/CPython API use.

**Change:** Section 9.4 now states explicitly that the `catch_unwind` guard wraps the entire PyO3-facing call, including the `allow_threads` scope, so a caught panic is converted to an `EngineError` only after the GIL has been reacquired on scope exit.

## Full Documentation Review (2026-09-04)

Reviewer: Claude (Cowork), acting as Principal Engineer / Lead Tech Architect, per project standing instructions.
Scope: a complete pass over `DESIGN.md`, `TECHNICAL.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION.md` in full, checking cross-references, verifying technical/API claims against fact rather than plausibility, and specifically auditing the Rust migration (#18) for completeness -- it had only touched the sections called out explicitly in its own change list, and the rest of each document was never re-swept for leftover C++.

Status: **All findings implemented.**

### 23. [Critical] Non-existent Rust API referenced
TECHNICAL.md Section 8 constrained sub-canvas concurrency to `std::thread::hardware_concurrency() - 1`. `hardware_concurrency()` is a C++11 `std::thread` member function; **Rust's `std::thread` module has no function of that name.** The correct Rust API is `std::thread::available_parallelism()` (stable since Rust 1.59), returning `io::Result<NonZeroUsize>`.

**Change:** Corrected to `std::thread::available_parallelism()` minus one, with the C++ name noted parenthetically so the mapping is traceable.

### 24. [Critical] Leftover, untranslated C++ syntax throughout
The Rust migration (#18) rewrote the two struct/trait code blocks in ARCHITECTURE.md but never swept the rest of the document set for C++ syntax embedded in prose and code snippets. Found and fixed:
- `std::atomic<size_t>::fetch_add` / `std::atomic::fetch_add` -- raw C++ template syntax (TECHNICAL.md §8, ARCHITECTURE.md §2.2, IMPLEMENTATION.md's Architectural Decision Matrix) -- corrected to `AtomicUsize::fetch_add`.
- A full C++ code line, `size_t writeOffset = globalCommandCounter.fetch_add(N_i, std::memory_order_relaxed);` (IMPLEMENTATION.md Step 5.2) -- corrected to `let write_offset = global_command_counter.fetch_add(n_i, Ordering::Relaxed);`.
- `memcpy` (IMPLEMENTATION.md Step 5.2) -- corrected to `copy_from_slice`.
- `uint64_t lastFrameUsed` (TECHNICAL.md §3.3, IMPLEMENTATION.md Step 2.3) -- corrected to `u64 last_frame_used`.
- `std::expected` as the error type for SVG-hardening rejections (IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 3.3), directly contradicting DESIGN.md §2.6's own `Result<T, EngineError>` rule -- corrected to `Result<T, EngineError>`.

### 25. [Critical] Pervasive PascalCase C++/C#-style API naming across all four documents
Every prose reference to the engine's own API -- `Canvas::DrawRoundedRect`, `Canvas::TagAccessibilityNode`, `RhiDevice::BeginFrame`, `IRhiCommandBuffer::DrawIndexed`, `Canvas::PushLayer`/`PopLayer`, `CreateSubCanvas`, `BeginOverlay`, and more -- was left in PascalCase-with-`::` C++/C# style, and one interface kept its C++ "I"-prefix (`IRhiCommandBuffer`) even though ARCHITECTURE.md §6's own canonical trait definition (part of #18's fix) had already renamed it to plain `RhiCommandBuffer`. This isn't cosmetic: TECHNICAL.md §9.2 commits the project to `clippy` with `-D warnings`, and `non_snake_case` is a default rustc lint -- a codebase matching these docs literally would not build clean under its own stated CI gate. Also caught in the same sweep: `SVGDocumentHandle` (DESIGN.md §6.1) violates the `clippy::upper_case_acronyms` convention Rust type names follow elsewhere in the same docs (`RhiDevice`, not `RHIDevice`) -- corrected to `SvgDocumentHandle`.

**Change:** Every such reference across DESIGN.md, TECHNICAL.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and IMPLEMENTATION.md renamed to snake_case methods on plain (non-`I`-prefixed) trait/type names -- roughly twenty individual sites. Real third-party API names quoted verbatim from Vulkan/DX12/PyO3 (`vkCmdDrawIndexed`, `ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::DrawIndexedInstanced`, `Python::allow_threads`) were left untouched, since those are correctly-cased external APIs, not TRE's own surface.

### 26. [Should-fix] "WinUI" mislabeled as the Windows accessibility bridge
DESIGN.md §5's architecture diagram labeled the accessibility bridge box "WinUI/NSAccess/AT-SPI." WinUI is Microsoft's separate native UI toolkit (WinUI 3 / Windows App SDK) -- unrelated to accessibility. The correct name, **UI Automation (UIA)**, is used correctly two sections later in the very same document (§5.2: "Windows UI Automation"), making this an internal inconsistency as well as a factual error.

**Change:** Diagram label corrected to "UIA/NSAccess/AT-SPI2" (also fixing "AT-SPI" to the more precise "AT-SPI2" used consistently elsewhere).

### 27. [Should-fix] Dangling cross-reference
DESIGN.md §2.6's SVG-hardening bullet cited "see Section 9.1 and IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 3.3" -- but DESIGN.md §9.1 ("SVG Capability Scope") only describes *what SVG features are supported*, never malformed-input handling or tessellation-cost bounding. The citation pointed readers to a section that doesn't contain what it claims to.

**Change:** Removed the inaccurate "Section 9.1" half of the citation; the accurate IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 3.3 reference (which does contain the hardening detail) is kept.

### 28. [Should-fix] Missing failure mode: transient render-target pool miss
DESIGN.md §2.6 enumerates five failure classes every subsystem must handle, but never addresses what happens when `Canvas::push_layer` requests an offscreen size/format the transient pool (TECHNICAL.md §3.2) doesn't already have -- despite this being at least as common in practice as several modes that *are* listed (any window resize, zoom-level change, or animated blur radius can produce a size never requested before).

**Change:** Added a sixth DESIGN.md §2.6 bullet: pool entries are bucketed to fixed size breakpoints so nearby requests share an entry, and a genuine miss borrows the next-larger already-pooled entry for that frame while a correctly-sized target grows into the pool asynchronously. Cross-referenced from TECHNICAL.md §3.2 and IMPLEMENTATION.md Step 2.2.

### 29. [Should-fix] `unsafe` policy gap reintroduced by its own prior fix
TECHNICAL.md §9.1's `unsafe` policy (established by finding #21) named a *closed* set of three permitted-unsafe locations -- RHI backends, ring-buffer/arena allocators, `tre-ffi`. It omitted wherever the SIMD/vector-math intrinsics live (IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 3.1's `core::arch::x86_64::_mm256_fmadd_ps` call), even though that code is explicitly required to sit inside an `unsafe` block. As written, that code has nowhere it's allowed to exist.

**Change:** Added the vector-math/SIMD crate as a fourth permitted-`unsafe` location, with the reasoning (`core::arch` intrinsics are inherently `unsafe` in Rust) stated inline.

### 30. [Should-fix] "Strictly 256-bit SIMD" isn't achievable on a target this same document requires
TECHNICAL.md §5.4 required SVG path-morphing interpolation to use "strictly ... 256-bit SIMD processing." 256-bit SIMD (AVX2/YMM) exists on x86_64; ARM64 NEON is 128-bit, and there is no portable 256-bit SIMD width on ARM64. Section 2.2 of the very same document requires ARM64/NEON support, so "strictly 256-bit" was never satisfiable on half the engine's stated CPU targets.

**Change:** Reworded to require "the widest SIMD width available on the target," with the concrete 256-bit-vs-128-bit split spelled out and the implication (this cannot be one shared intrinsic-level code path across architectures) stated explicitly rather than left implicit.

### 31. [Nice-to-have] Metal version / macOS floor pairing looks mismatched
TECHNICAL.md §2.1 paired "Metal 2.4+" with "macOS 10.14+." Metal 2.4 and Argument Buffers Tier 2 shipped years after Mojave (10.14, 2018); asserting a specific corrected macOS version here without checking Apple's current Metal Feature Set tables risks swapping one unverified number for another.

**Change:** Rather than guess a replacement, the doc now flags this pairing explicitly as unverified and instructs implementers to check Apple's current Feature Set tables before building against it.

### 32. [Nice-to-have] Crate-name imprecision
IMPLEMENTATION.md referred to "the `windows-rs` crate" and "the `freetype-rs` binding crate." Those are the names of the upstream GitHub projects; the packages actually published to crates.io are named `windows` and `freetype` respectively.

**Change:** Both references clarified to name the actual crates.io package alongside the project name.

## Engineering Decisions: Suggested Improvements Actioned (2026-09-04)

Following the full documentation review above, seven engineering suggestions raised during that review were directed by the project owner and implemented. These are design decisions, not bug fixes -- recorded here in the same numbered sequence for traceability.

### 33. [Decision] Multi-window atlas race resolved with a lock-free MPSC request queue + SWMR publish table
Two windows on independent render timelines could both discover a missing glyph in the same tick and need to mutate the single shared atlas; nothing in the docs specified how that's made safe. Directed: resolve with a lock-free structure for performance, not a mutex.

**Change:** Added DESIGN.md Section 10.3 (principle: single atlas owner, no window ever blocks on another) and ARCHITECTURE.md Section 2.3 (concrete design: a bounded MPSC ring buffer carries insertion requests from any window to the one atlas owner; the owner is the only code that ever touches the Guillotine free-rectangle list; completed results publish into a fixed-capacity single-writer/multi-reader `AtomicU64` slot table that every window reads lock-free via `Ordering::Acquire`/`Release`). TECHNICAL.md Section 8 specifies the concurrency primitives. A window whose glyph isn't yet published falls back to the existing placeholder-glyph degradation path (DESIGN.md Section 2.6) for that one frame rather than stalling.

### 34. [Decision] Clip-bucketing bit budget corrected: steal from Pipeline ID, not Depth ID
The originally-suggested fix for ARCHITECTURE.md Section 4.2's deferred clip-bucketing enhancement didn't specify which sort-key field would donate bits. Directed: take them from Pipeline ID.

**Change:** ARCHITECTURE.md Section 4.2 now states explicitly that Depth ID must not be touched -- it was widened from 16 to 20 bits in finding #10 specifically because 16 bits' 6.5x margin was judged too thin, and reusing that budget would silently reintroduce the exact problem that fix closed. Pipeline ID (16 bits / 65,536 states) has substantial real slack for a UI-focused engine's realistic pipeline-family count; trimming it to roughly 10-12 bits frees 4-6 bits for a future clip-group field. The live 64-bit layout is unchanged -- this only corrects the guidance for whenever clip-bucketing is actually implemented.

### 35. [Decision] Adopt the `wide` crate instead of hand-written duplicate AVX2/NEON code
Directed: use `wide` to avoid maintaining two hand-written SIMD implementations.

**Change:** TECHNICAL.md Sections 2.2, 5.4, and 7.2, and IMPLEMENTATION.md Steps 3.1 and 3.3, updated to specify `wide`'s portable `f32x4`/`f32x8` types as the primary SIMD path -- one shared, safe source-level implementation that compiles to native AVX2 on x86_64 and transparently emulates 256-bit operations as paired 128-bit NEON operations on ARM64. Because `wide`'s public API is safe Rust, this also *removed* the vector-math crate from TECHNICAL.md Section 9.1's `unsafe`-permitted list (previously added by finding #29) -- raw `core::arch` intrinsics are no longer needed for this code path, so the crate doesn't need `unsafe` at all.

### 36. [Decision] Wire native GPU API validation layers into debug/CI builds
Directed: add this CI gate.

**Change:** Added IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 2 Step 2.4 "GPU API Validation in Debug & CI Builds" (Vulkan validation layers, the D3D12 debug layer, Metal API validation, each gated to debug/CI only and failing the build on any validation error) and a corresponding TECHNICAL.md Section 9.2 CI bullet. This specifically covers the one class of bug the existing CPU-side gates (zero-allocation guard, `clippy`, batching-equivalence tests) cannot see: misuse at the `unsafe` FFI boundary into the raw graphics APIs.

### 37. [Decision] `FxHashMap`/`ahash` for the transient-pool and atlas hot-path lookups
Directed: use a faster non-cryptographic hasher for these two structures.

**Change:** TECHNICAL.md Section 3.2 and IMPLEMENTATION.md Steps 2.2 and 4.2 updated to specify `FxHashMap`/`ahash` in place of `std::collections::HashMap`'s default SipHash for the transient render-target pool and the atlas owner's internal LRU bookkeeping. Made explicit in the same edits: this is a distinct structure from the lock-free `AtomicU64` slot table added by #33 -- a hasher swap makes single-threaded lookups faster, it does not make anything safe for concurrent access.

### 38. [Decision] Opaque-first depth-tested pre-pass flagged as a profiling-gated future consideration
Directed: note this for future profiling rather than building it now.

**Change:** Added a "Future consideration -- not implemented" note to ARCHITECTURE.md Section 6.1, describing the technique (a front-to-back depth-tested pre-pass for provably-opaque batches, reclaiming early-Z rejection the current depth-test-off design forgoes) and its costs, with an explicit instruction not to build it until profiling a representative overdraw-heavy scene confirms GPU time, not CPU submission time, is the actual bottleneck.

### 39. [Decision] Replaced ACES filmic tone mapping with a UI-appropriate default curve
Directed: this is a desktop UI engine, not a photo/film/image tool -- ACES's cinematic contrast and desaturation shaping is the wrong default; use something gentler.

**Change:** Added a new canonical formula, TECHNICAL.md Section 6.3 "HDR-to-SDR Tone Mapping": identity below standard white (every ordinary UI color reaches the screen bit-for-bit unchanged) and a continuous, monotonic Reinhard-style compression of only the content explicitly authored above white (audio meter peaks, HDR video preview, brightness indicators, per DESIGN.md Section 11.2), parameterized by the display's actual reported headroom rather than a fixed constant. ACES remains available as an explicit opt-in style choice for creative-workstation/DAW integrations that specifically want it for embedded video content, but is no longer the default. DESIGN.md Section 11.2 and IMPLEMENTATION.md Section 7.1 updated to reference the new canonical formula.

| 39 | UI-appropriate tone-mapping curve replaces ACES default | TECHNICAL, DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION | Decision | Implemented — new canonical formula, TECHNICAL §6.3 |

Note on #11: this one is deliberately documented rather than "solved," per the finding's own conclusion — folding `clipBounds` into the sort key isn't possible without shrinking Layer, Pipeline, or the now-widened Depth field, and the risk is a performance regression (more batches than optimal), not a correctness bug. A clip-bucketing secondary pass is named as the future fix if profiling ever shows it matters.
