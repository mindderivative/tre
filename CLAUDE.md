# Standing Instructions

## Project Policy
* **GitHub Project:** Update and maintain the GitHub project `Tesserae Rendering Engine`. Each issue is a milestone and each phase is a task with steps as subtasks. Use comments to keep track of the findings, error, failures, and the fixes.
* **Backlog:** Draft issues, fixes, updates, features, and recommendations then place them into the `Backlog`.
* **Ready:** Scope approved `Backlog` entries and move them to `Ready`.
* **In progress:** Move entries from `Ready` to `In progress` when work begins on an entry.
* **In review:** When an entry in `In progress` is completed move it to `In review` and wait for the entry to be approved.
* **Done:** Move approved `In review` entries to `Done` then update documentation on the finished entry.

## Memory Policy
* **YOU MUST** update your local memory using the memory MCP server as soon as a local commit finishes.

## Documentation Policy
* **IMPORTANT:** Update all relevant documentation immediately upon completing any milestone, phase, stage, step, or feature.

## Commit Policy
* **YOU MUST** commit locally and automatically as soon as a milestone, phase, stage, step, or feature is finished.
* **Commit Messages:** Match the repository's existing commit style (run `git log` to verify formatting). Do not pause to ask or wait for an explicit `/commit` command.
* **Scope Restriction:** This authorization applies strictly to **local commits only**. Pushing to a remote repository is explicitly prohibited without separate, human-gated instruction.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- When graphify-out/graph.json exists, run `graphify query "<question>"` before your first grep, search or source-file read for a codebase question, and put this rule in every subagent prompt that explores code. Read raw files only for lines the graph or an earlier read already located. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
- A committed graphify-out/graph.json is rewritten whole on every build, so a large diff to it in a pull request is expected. Do not flag it as churn or suggest skipping the graph rebuild or its hooks.
